Of course. Here is a rewritten version of the README.
I've tightened up the language for clarity and impact, and have removed the reference to "Go" in the roadmap as you requested.

A simple CLI tool to automate the creation of essential security starter files for your projects.

## The Problem

Every project needs a `SECURITY.md` file, `dependabot.yml` config, and basic security guidelines. But it’s a boring, repetitive chore that’s easy to neglect, leaving most projects without them until it's too late.

## The Solution

`aegis` is a command-line tool that handles the grunt work. It scans your project, detects the primary language, and generates essential security starter files from best-practice templates. It turns a 15-minute chore into a 3-second command.

## Disclaimer: This is a Starting Point

Let's be clear: **this tool is a starting point, not a magic bullet.** It generates boilerplate documentation and is **NOT** a vulnerability scanner, security audit tool, or a replacement for a comprehensive security strategy. You are still responsible for writing secure code and using dedicated security tools.

## Features

* **Language Detection**: Scans your project to identify the language (currently supports Python and JavaScript).
* **Essential File Generation**: Creates the following from proven templates:
    * `.github/dependabot.yml`: A ready-to-use config to keep dependencies updated via GitHub.
    * `security/SECURITY.md`: A solid, customizable policy for vulnerability reporting.
    * `security/SecureCodingGuide.md`: A language-specific checklist for secure coding practices.
* **Safe & Customizable**: Use `--dry-run` to preview changes without writing files and `--output` to specify a custom directory.

## Installation

Install directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install praximous-aegis-cli

Or, to contribute, clone the repository and install in editable mode:
git clone [https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/Project-Aegis-CLI.git](https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/Project-Aegis-CLI.git)
cd Project-Aegis-CLI
pip install -e .[test]

How to Use It
Navigate to your project's root directory and run the command:
aegis /path/to/your/project

Options
 * --output <directory>: Specify a custom output directory for security files.
 * --verbose: See a detailed report of the scan as it runs.
 * --dry-run: Preview changes without writing any files to disk.
The Roadmap
The current version is a solid foundation. Future development is focused on:
 * Support for more languages (e.g., Java, Rust).
 * Optional integration with security tools like Snyk or OSV.
 * Greater customization of the generated template files.
