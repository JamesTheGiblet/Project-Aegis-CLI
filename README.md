## üöÄ My Mission: Building the Tools for Digital Sovereignty

I believe in building technology that empowers individuals. My work focuses on creating tools and systems that are private-by-design, user-owned, and built to last. Below is a selection of projects that serve as tangible evidence of this philosophy.

## üß∞ Featured Projects & Research

### üõ°Ô∏è **PROJECT: Aegis-CLI ‚Äî Security Starter Kit**
***A command-line tool that automates the creation of essential, boilerplate security files for any project.***

* **Problem:** Creating basic security files like `SECURITY.md` and `dependabot.yml` is a repetitive chore that is frequently neglected by developers.
* **Solution:** A Python-based CLI that detects the project's language and generates best-practice security starter files from templates.
* **Outcome:** Compresses a 15-minute manual chore into a 3-second command, ensuring projects start with a solid security baseline.
* **Skills:** `Python` `CLI Development` `Automation` `Developer Tooling` `Security Best Practices`

### üß† **PROJECT: DPMS ‚Äî The Private AI Personality Blueprint**
***A privacy-first AI platform that models human personality, running entirely on a local machine with zero cloud dependencies.***

* **Problem:** Cloud-based AI tools force a trade-off between utility and privacy, requiring users to surrender sensitive personal data.
* **Solution:** A local-first AI platform using Ollama that provides deep personality insights without data ever leaving the user's machine.
* **Outcome:** Establishes a new paradigm for AI tools built on digital sovereignty, proving the viability of a privacy-centric, local-first model.
* **Skills:** `Python` `AI/ML` `Local LLM Integration` `NLP` `Privacy-by-Design Architecture` `Streamlit` `SQLite`

### ü§ñ **PROJECT: Johnny 5 "Number 3" ‚Äî Advanced Robotics Platform**
***An advanced, multi-brain robotics platform designed as a serious challenge for integrated engineering skills.***

* **Problem:** Most robotics kits are too simplistic for serious builders who want to master the integration of complex, multi-domain systems.
* **Solution:** A complete architectural blueprint for a modular, multi-brain robot, distributing tasks across multiple processors.
* **Outcome:** A tangible proof of cross-domain mastery in mechanical, electronic, and software engineering, and an extensible platform for advanced AI/robotics research.
* **Skills:** `Systems Integration` `Hardware Engineering` `Electronics` `Distributed Systems` `Power Management` `Technical Writing`
